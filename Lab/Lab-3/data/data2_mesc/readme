The first dataset contains 182 mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) that were flow sorted into one of three cell cycle phases: G, S, and G2/M and sequenced using the Fluidigm C1 platform combined with Illumina sequencing [Buettner et al., 2015]. The data contain 9571 genes and a zero-proportion of 0.41.
